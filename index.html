    and machine learning to decode Lifeâ€™s complexity.</span> </b> <br> <br> 


Welcome to my personal page! As of May 2023, 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol's institute of statistical mathematics, 
under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=kcsbLrAAAAAJ&hl=en" >Christophe Andrieu </a>. Before that, I was a PhD student in 
the  <a href="https://biocomputelab.github.io/" > Biocompute Lab </a> at the University of Bristol led by <a href="https://biocomputelab.github.io/team/thomas-gorochowski/">Thomas Gorochowski </a>. <br> <br> 

My research interests lie primarily in computational biology, machine learning, and statistics.
 I am particularly fond of methods using high-throughput datasets (experimental and/or simulation-based) 
 to probe molecular mechanisms. During my PhD, I studied RNA-mediated gene regulation to accelerate the 
 design of synthetic biological sequences. Using machine learning techniques, I explored how to map 
 RNA sequences to protein abundances leveraging vast datasets.<br> <br> 
Currently, I am researching generative models (mostly diffusion-based) with applications to 
macromolecular design (Proteins, RNA).
Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss any projects!
