<span style="color:navy;font-size:23px"> **Computational biologist integrating high throughput experiments and machine learning to decode Life’s complexity.**</span>


Welcome to my personal page! As of May 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol's institute of statistical mathematics, under the guidance of Christophe Andrieu. Before that, I was a PhD student in the biocompute lab at the University of Bristol led by Thomas Gorochowski.

My research interests lie primarily in computational biology, machine learning, and statistics. I am particularly fond of methods using high-throughput datasets (experimental and/or simulation-based) to probe molecular mechanisms. During my PhD, I studied RNA-mediated gene regulation to accelerate the design of synthetic biological sequences. Using machine learning techniques, I explored how to map RNA sequences to protein abundances leveraging vast datasets.

Currently, I am researching generative models (mostly diffusion-based) with applications to macromolecular design (Proteins, RNA).
